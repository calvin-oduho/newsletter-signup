A sign-up platform for a newsletter that utilizes the Mailchimp API to store the name and email of new signees. 
Begin by installing the relevant dependences i.e., body-parser and express using the command: [npm i].
Kindly remember to provide the API server (the last characters on your API key starting with us**, e.g. us11) API key, and listID (which have been left blank in the app.js file) before running the application. 
The API key is filled in as follows: "randomWord:APIkey" as a single string. 
The two parts MUST be separated by a colon as shown in my example here -> "user:2d6a0fc4h3678jy6286n10kjh6cbd2fa-us20". 
You could provide any valid API key and listID and the app will work just fine. 
If you do not have them, you can easily sign-up on the Mailchimp platform and get them for free (NB: Your credit card information will NOT be required for this). 
After providing these details, remember to save before running the app.
Enjoy!
