A sign-up platform for a newsletter that utilizes the Mailchimp API to store the name and email of new signees. 
Kindly remember to provide the API server (the last characters on your API key starting with us**, e.g. us11) API key, and listID, which have been left blank in the app.js file before running the application. 
The API key is filled in as follows: "randomWord:APIkey" as a single string. 
The two parts MUST be separated by a colon as shown in my example here -> "user:2d6a0fc4h3678jy6286n10kjh6cbd2fa-us20". 
You could provide any valid API key and listID and the app will work just fine. 
If you do not have one, you can easily sign-up on the Mailchimp platform and get them for free. 
After providing these details, remember to save before running the app.
Enjoy!
